Greetings Everyone,
Is there a game more beautiful than tennis, we often ask ourselves. We fail to come up with any answer other than a resounding "No."
                                                                                                                                                              So, in an attempt to recreate and relive the evergreen moments of tennis and to boost the talent of young players, we bring to you "AEC GRAND SLAM" under the banner of "Pyrokinesis 2022". Come and join us in this voyage of tennis in ASSAM ENGINEERING COLLEGE and leave your mark on the court.                                                                                              PLAY WITH RESPECT, WIN WITH GRACE.
